# SIMTPeridigm
[Peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm) is an open-source computational peridynamics code developed at Sandia National Laboratories for massively-parallel multi-physics simulations. It has been applied primarily to problems in solid mechanics involving pervasive material failure. Peridigm is a C++ code utilizing foundational software components from Sandia's Trilinos project and is fully compatible with the Cubit mesh generator and Paraview visualization code. </br>
To provide high-perforamnce long-term and large-scale Peridynamics simulations, we redesign the Peridigm to let Peridigm can be accelerated by accelerators e.g. GPUs.
## Getting started
Peridigm is a C++ code intended for use on Mac and Linux operating systems. Both Peridigm and the Trilinos libraries it depends on should be built using MPI compilers and the CMake build system. The Peridigm test harness requires python. The build process has been tested using gcc and Intel compilers, Open MPI, and MPICH. The steps below should be followed in order, beginning with installation of the required third-party libraries. To make it run the SIMT accelerators, CUDA or HIP are also needed. </br>
To install our code, users need to install third-party packges and the original version of Peridigm. Later compiled our code to a dynamic-linked library. The example script for installing is in `build/` and the example scripts for compiled code are in `src/gpu_kenel/nvcc_src` and `src/gpukernel/hip_src`.</br>
