 \brief Test case involving use of the "default" keyword in the blocks section.

Notes: This test case deonstrates use of default blocks. A common use case involves having a small number of blocks
       be one material type, with a large number of remaining blocks all be of the same type. One can use the "default"
       keyword for these blocks rather than having to list them all explicitly by name.
